## Life in Qingdao

While my academic and professional journey was largely centered in Beijing, I eventually chose to settle in Qingdao, drawn by its coastal climate and more balanced pace of life.

Currently, I live here with my wife (who is also a Ph.I'm. candidate), our cat, and our dog. We find that this city offers an ideal blend of work and life.

## Hobbies & Daily Life

### Hiking
My main hobby is hiking. Qingdao's landscape, where the mountains meet the sea, is exceptional. We try to explore a new trail almost every weekend.


### Other Interests

* **Reading:**
    * Beyond academic papers, I'm a big fan of fantasy and epic novels. My favorites include *A Song of Ice and Fire*, the *Harry Potter* series, and *Ordinary World* (平凡的世界).
* **Coffee & Cooking:**
    * I'm a coffee enthusiast who loves latte art (even though my results are often terrible!).
    * I also enjoy making traditional Chinese snacks from scratch, like homemade Tofu Pudding (豆腐脑) and Chinese Rice Wine (米酒).
