## Life in Qingdao

While my academic and professional journey was largely centered in Beijing, I eventually chose to settle in Qingdao, drawn by its coastal climate and more balanced pace of life.

Currently, I live here with my wife (who is a Ph.I'm. candidate), our cat, and our dog. We find that this city offers an ideal blend of work and life.

## Hobbies & Daily Life

### Hiking
My main hobby is hiking. Qingdao's landscape, where the mountains meet the sea, is exceptional. We try to explore a new trail almost every weekend.


### Other Interests

* **Reading:**
    * Beyond academic papers, I'm a big fan of fantasy and epic novels. My favorites include *A Song of Ice and Fire*, the *Harry Potter* series, and *Ordinary World* (平凡的世界).
* **Plant Care:**  
    * I find great joy in the lush, vibrant sight of thriving plants. Watching new leaves unfurl at their own pace and flowers bloom quietly brings me a sense of calm and healing happiness.
* **Coffee & Cooking:**
    * I'm a coffee enthusiast who loves latte art (even though my results are often terrible!).
    * I also enjoy making traditional Chinese snacks from scratch, like homemade Tofu Pudding (豆腐脑) and Chinese Rice Wine (米酒).
* **Tea Appreciation**
    * Besides coffee, I also have a deep fondness for tea. I enjoy brewing it slowly with an exquisite tea set, observing the leaves gently unfurl in the water, and savoring the evolving notes from delicate aroma to sweet aftertaste.
